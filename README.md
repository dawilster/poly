## What is Poly?
[Poly](https://poly.chat) is a universal chat room where regardless of what language you speak can communicate with people of all languages from around the world in real time. 

## Why I built Poly? 
[Poly](https://poly.chat) is a side-project of mine I’ve been working on in my free time the past couple months. It all started when a podcast I was listening to raised the idea of 2 billion extra internet users in the next 10 - 15 years, due to advancements in low earth satellite technology. I thought amazing! But how are all these people going to be able to communicate with each other. Oceans used to separate us, now with the internet all that’s left is language.  

So I thought surely Translation APIs by now would be strong enough for universal chat to be possible so I built Poly to test my hypothesis.
